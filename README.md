# CatRAT
<b>FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE FOR NEFARIUOS PURPOSES</b>

This is a simple RAT that allows you to execute commands on the "client" computer.
It does not give Admin permissions.

It also has no networking implementation because I want it to be an educational project.
It communicates with txt files.

(This is my first "big" C++ project so feedback is much appreciated)
