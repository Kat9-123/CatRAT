# CAT
<b>FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE FOR NEFARIUOS PURPOSES</b>
This is a simple RAT that allows you to execute standard windows command prompt commands on the "client" computer.
It does not give Admin permissions.

It also has no networking implementation because I want it to be an educational project.
It communicates via the txt files.
